<h2>VERY LONG INSTRUCTION WORD</h2>
</head>
  <body>
    <p>The very long instruction word (VLIW) approach makes
extensive use of the compiler by requiring it to incorporate several small independent operations into a long
instruction word. The instruction is large enough to provide, in parallel, enough control bits over many
functional units. In other words, a VLIW architecture provides many more functional units than a typical
processor design, together with a compiler that finds parallelism across basic operations to keep the
functional units as busy as possible. The compiler compacts ordinary sequential codes into long instruction
words that make better use of resources. During execution, the control unit issues one long instruction per
cycle. The issued instruction initiates many independent operations simultaneously. </p>
<p>A comparison of the three approaches will show a few interesting differences. For instance, the superscalar
and VLIW approaches are more sensitive to resource conflicts than the superpipelined approach. In a
superscalar or VLIW processor, a resource must be duplicated to reduce the chance of conflicts, while the
superpipelined design avoids any resource conflicts. </p>
<p>To prevent the superpipelined processor from being slower than the superscalar, the technology used in the
superpipelined must reduce the delay of the lengthy instruction pipeline. Therefore, in general,
superpipelined designs require faster transistor technology such as GaAs (gallium arsinide), whereas
superscalar designs require more transistors to account for the hardware resource duplication. The
superscalar design often uses CMOS technology, since this technology provides good circuit density.
Although superpipelining seems to be a more straightforward solution than superscaling, existing
technology generally favors increasing circuit density over increasing circuit speed. Historically, circuit
density has increased at a faster rate than transistor speed. This historical precedent suggests a general
conclusion that the superscalar approach is more cost effective for industry to implement. </p>
<p>Technological advances have allowed superscalar and superpipelining techniques to be combined,
providing good solutions to many current efficiency problems found in the computing industry. Such
solutions, which attempt to take advantage of the positive attributes of each design, can be studied in
existing processors. One example is the alpha microprocessor [DIG 92].</p>
