  <h2>SUPERSCALAR</h2>
  </head>

    <p>The superscalar approach relies on spatial parallelism, that is, multiple operations running
concurrently on separate hardware. This approach achieves the execution of multiple instructions per clock
cycle by issuing several instructions to different functional units. A superscalar processor contains one or
more instruction pipelines sharing a set of functional units. It often contains functional units, such as an add
unit, multiply unit, divide unit, floating-point add unit, and graphic unit. A superscalar processor contains a
control mechanism to preserve the execution order of dependent instructions for ensuring a valid result.
The scoreboard method and Tomasulo's method (discussed in the previous section) can be used for
implementing such mechanisms. In practice, most of the processors are based on the superscalar approach
and employ a scoreboard method to ensure a valid result.</p>
