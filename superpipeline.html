    <h2>SUPERPIPELINE</h2>
    <p>The superpipeline approach achieves high performance by overlapping the execution of
multiple instructions on one instruction pipeline. A superpipeline processor often has an instruction
pipeline with more stages than a typical instruction pipeline design. In other words, the execution process
of an instruction is broken down into even finer steps. By increasing the number of stages in the instruction
pipeline, each stage has less work to do. This allows the pipeline clock rate to increase (cycle time
decreases), since the clock rate depends on the delay found in the slowest stage of the pipeline.
</P>
 <p>An example of such an architecture is the MIPS R4000 processor. The R4000 subdivides instruction
fetching and data cache access to create an eight-stage pipeline. The stages are instruction fetch first half,
instruction fetch second half, register fetch, instruction execute, data cache access first half, data cache
access second half, tag check, and write back. </p>
<p>A superpipeline approach has certain benefits. The single functional unit requires less space and less logic
on the chip than designs based on the superscalar approach. This extra space on the chip allows room for
specialize circuitry to achieve higher speeds, room for large caches, and wide data paths. </p>
